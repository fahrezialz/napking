Heard u insane
With the noise in ur head
Surrender, but u still win again
Tell story to the rain
Dont know what u feelin
And Look now, u cryin at 3

Someones calling, go check up ur phone
No name showing, realize u still alone
And i know, yea i know
I am sorry

Demons all around me and i fight them alone
They said they can save me but look, im still alone
They said i look happier but i dont think so
Crying every single night and nobody knows

Here comes the storm
All night long
Oh i cant hear, its inside of my head
Too much sound, its too loud
And i lost all my pride
And once again, im crying at 3

Finish ur job, blank space come again
Layin on bed, feel nothing do nothing
Tears drop feels better than every light
And i see no one in sight

But
Someones calling, go check up ur phone
No name showing, realize u still alone
And i know, yea i know
I am sorry

Demons all around me and i fight them alone
They said they can save me but look, im still alone
They said i look happier but i dont think so
Crying every single night and nobody knows

Demons all around me and i fight them alone
They said they can save me but look, im still alone
They said i look happier but i dont think so
Crying every single night and nobody knows

Nobody knows
